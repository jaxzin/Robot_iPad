Arduino Nunchuck Robot
===================

A simple robot that has two modes, one where it is controlled by the joystick of a Wii nunchuck and another where it roams autonomously while attempting to voiding obstacles.

Requirements
-------
To use this project you'll need the following:

* [Arduino](http://arduino.cc), A development environment for the Arduino microprocessor, you'll use this to install the serial --> servo sketch on your Arduino.
* A Wii nunchuck connected to your Arduino (clock on A4, data on A5), and the [arduino-nunchuck](http://gitorious.org/randomstuff/arduino-nunchuk) library.
* A standard servo connected to pin 9 of your Arduino.
* A [LadyAda Motor shield](http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/)
* The motors, wheels and IR range sensor from [Let's Make Robots Starter project](http://letsmakerobots.com/start)

Usage
